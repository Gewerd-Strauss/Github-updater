# Github-updater
Function for updating ahk-scripts and included scripts from github. 

This will be filled in at the end.  
Mind that this is a beta-build, it is not fully bug-proofed yet. 
Among the things missing are error-codes and error-messages, proper inline-documentation, a proper readme and a few features that may be added.
